Basically, I need to create a program where a user enters height. The program then takes that height and turns it into a pyramid. If the user enters 0, then it will be blank. If the user enters a negative number, or a positive number greater than 23, then that user will be prompted to give another number. If the user enters 1 then the program will simply give two hashtags. If the user enters 2 then there will be one space, 2 dash, new line, 3 dash.

If the user enters 4 then there will be 2 spaces, 2 dash, new line, 1 space, 3 dash, new line, no space, 4 dash.
